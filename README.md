## ⚡️Getting Started

Make sure you already React Native environment running in you machine. Please refer to the official [docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)

### 🚚 How to run

I build this on expo so there is no additional configuration needed but you need to download expo go application on your pyshical device.

```shell
yarn install #or npm install depending on your environment
yarn start
# it will show qr code, you can scan it with your camera app then it will open expo go app
```
